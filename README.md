# Being a SLIIT FOSS Community Board Member
👩‍💻 Where you be a Board Member

This repository is for:
- Discussing and planning activities we might do on our SLIIT,
- Requesting help, support or materials from other communities,
- Tracking and talking about the activities you are doing,
- Anything else you need to be a successful Community Leader!

## How it works:

- 🚩 Open an issue
- ⚠️ Add labels, don't forget: where you are, what type of thing you're doing, what you need
- 🤵🏽💁 Tag anyone you think can help you
- ✨ Do the thing!
- 👍 Tell us how it went
- ✅ Close the issue 

### *Example:* I want to host a workshop on my campus

🚩 **Open an issue**

I open an issue "Atom workshop", and describe what I'm planning to do according to the issue template.

⚠️ **Add lables**

I add the labels  "Workshop" to describe where I am and what I'm doing, and add "swag wanted" because we would like find Atom stickers

🤵🙋🏿 **Tag anyone you think can help you**

I tag a Ambassadors to help me with the swag request, [@Shehanka](https://github.com/Shehanka) because I know he's another Campus Expert near by and might want to help, and both of them because I think they can contribute to my workshop content and plan.

✨ **Do the thing!**

After getting the help we need, we hold the workshop.

👍 **Tell how it went**

We come back to the issue to tell everyone how it went! I might include photos from the event, relevant social media posts and number of attendees. I will create the post event report using the [Post Event Template]() and submit any expenses by following the [Expense procedure]()

✅ **Close the issue**

Done!
